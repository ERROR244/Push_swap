## Introduction

`Push_swap` is a project from the 42 curriculum that involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of operations, and the smallest possible number of actions. The project consists of two programs:

- **Push_swap**: Generates a sequence of instructions to sort the stack.
- **Checker**: Verifies if a given sequence of instructions correctly sorts the stack.

The goal of this project is to sort a stack of integers using a series of push and swap operations, while minimizing the total number of instructions used.

## Features

- Sort a stack of integers with a limited set of operations:
  - `sa` (swap a): Swap the first two elements at the top of stack A.
  - `sb` (swap b): Swap the first two elements at the top of stack B.
  - `ss`: `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
  - `pa` (push a): Take the first element at the top of stack B and put it on stack A.
  - `pb` (push b): Take the first element at the top of stack A and put it on stack B.
  - `ra` (rotate a): Shift all elements of stack A up by one.
  - `rb` (rotate b): Shift all elements of stack B up by one.
  - `rr`: `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
  - `rra` (reverse rotate a): Shift all elements of stack A down by one.
  - `rrb` (reverse rotate b): Shift all elements of stack B down by one.
  - `rrr`: `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.

## Algorithm

The `Push_swap` project requires implementing efficient sorting algorithms to minimize the number of operations needed to sort the stack. Some common algorithms used in `Push_swap` include:

- **Bubble Sort**: Simple but inefficient for large inputs.
- **Insertion Sort**: Efficient for small datasets but may require more operations for larger datasets.
- **Quick Sort**: Often used in `Push_swap` to minimize the number of operations.
- **Radix Sort**: A non-comparative sorting algorithm, often used for large datasets in `Push_swap`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ERROR244/Push_swap.git
   cd push_swap
   make         # for Mandatory part
   make bonus   # for bonus part
   ```

### Usage
Push_swap: Generates a series of operations to sort the stack.

```sh
    ./push_swap <list_of_integers>
```

Checker: Validates the operations generated by push_swap.

```sh
./checker <list_of_integers>
```
#### Example
```sh
# Example of using push_swap with a list of integers
./push_swap 3 2 5 1 4

# Example of using push_swap with checker
ARG="3 2 5 1 4"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
### Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated on the following criteria:\
- Efficiency: The number of operations used to sort the stack.\
- Correctness: The generated operations must correctly sort the stack.\
- Code quality: Readability, structure, and adherence to the 42 Norm.
